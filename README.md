- 👋 Hi, I’m @baluticristi
- 👀 I’m interested in Automation and Networking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, C, C#, React, Python and Kotlin,
but I am trying to broaden my horizons when it comes to programming languages I know.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project that I can help with.
- 📫 How to reach me? Contact me directly on my email: baluticristi11@gmail.com .

I'm a romanian computer science engineer and I studied at the Military Technical Academy, in Bucharest! 
I could say I am proficient in english, and there isn't gonna be any language barrier if you try to contact me.
