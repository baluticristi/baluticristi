- 👋 Hi, I’m @baluticristi
- 👀 I’m interested in Automation and Networking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++,C and Python at university,

I'm a romanian student, studying computer science at the Military Technical Academy, in Bucharest! 
I could say I am proficient in english, and there isn't gonna be any language barrier if you try to contact me.

  At the moment I am looking for an opportunity to begin my career in software development,
and I am trying to see which domanin attracts me the most.
